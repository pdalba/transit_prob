# transit_prob

This is a Python script that uses physical and orbital parameters for an exoplanet to calculate a probability distribution for its transit probability. It assumes or fits normal or skew normal probability distributions to parameter values and uncertainties, then draws from those distributions to calculate transit probability in a Monte Carlo Simulation. 

The code is thoroughly commented but is also relatively hard-coded to accept data in a specific format. This can be manipulated as you see fit. I have a provided example files of the input data for guidance in creating input files. 

For details about the script or the relating project, please see the in press/published article:
